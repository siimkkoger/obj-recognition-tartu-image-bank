# Using YOLOv7 as one method for University of Tartu school project.

We need to find multiple objects from images to be able to add labels to pictures.

File "detect_custom.py" is a little rework of detect.py from the original repo https://github.com/wongkinyiu/yolov7
To use it clone the original repo and add this file there.
