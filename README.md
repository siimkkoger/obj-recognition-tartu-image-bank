Background
Tartu or as it is also known as “The City of great thoughts” is the second most populated city in Estonia. It is famous for its university, rich history and aspiration to innovate and make citizens’ lives better.
Tartu has its own image bank, which contains 134 000 images divided into folders by general topics. Unfortunately, images are not systematically labeled, which makes searching for the right picture complicated.

The accurate prediction model would help Tartu to make the public images searchable and reusable.

Goal
The goal of this competition is to label the images from the image bank of the city of Tartu.
